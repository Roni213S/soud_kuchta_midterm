<h2>AGAINST</h2>
<p>I am Liam and I'm arguing for Jake Paul. Jake paul is superior to Logan Paul because he beat crippled <br>
70 year old Mike Tyson in a boxing match. Jake Paul was on disney channel which makes him suuper cool. <br>
Jake Paul created the best song ever called "it's everyday bro". He has more subscribers than Logan Paul <br>
so he's pretty sick. Logan Paul sucks because he created a drink called "prime" and it has an uneven <br>
potassium to sodium ratio.
